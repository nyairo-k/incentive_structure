# incentive_structure
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on taskforce dataset to develop an optimized incentive structure
I have 1200 field agents, different personas, different task completion rates, varying consistencies. Whats the best way to come up with a optimal compensation structure?
Motive is to have an incentive structure that motivates them to step to the edge and promotes healthy perfomance transitions
